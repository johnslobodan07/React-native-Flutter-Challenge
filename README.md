# React-native and Flutter-Challenge

## Overview

To complete this challenge, you will need to write a simple [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) or [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) based mobile app, and provide us the source files to be built. Build a small React Native / Flutter application. Using a tool like create-react-native-app is a great way to get this project started.

All the architecture and tooling are entirely up to you as well. Code in an environment that makes you most comfortable!

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your **skills and approach to composing a simple web app** given a set of screens, and an API feed. We will also assess the **generated APK** output.

This challenge is expected to take about 8 hours.
